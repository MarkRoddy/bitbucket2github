BitBucket2GitHub
=============================

What is it?
-----------------------------------------
BitBucket and GitHub are two popular services for developers to host and share their code online. Nowadays it is a common practice to mirror a project's source code in both services so that users can easily watch and fork the project from their favorite service.

But manually syncing BitBucket and GitHub is tedious and error prone. I developed this little package to automate the syncing both ways.

How to use it?
-----------------------------------------
* Call "bitbucket2github" to mirror all public repos in BitBucket account to GitHub. It will prompt you for BitBucket username, GitHub username and GitHub API key.
* Call "github2bitbucket" to mirror all public repos in GitHub account to BitBucket. It will prompt you for GitHub username, BitBucket username and BitBucket password.
